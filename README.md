# Root Finding Methods in Rust
Approximate the root of a given function using several root finding methods.

## Overview
1) Write a program to find an approximation to the solution to the equation f(x) = 0 lying in [a, b] that is accurate to within 10⁻⁶, using: 

    a. The bisection method 
    b. The fixed-point iteration method
    c. The Newton's method
    d. The secant method \
where f(x) = x⁴ - 3x² - 3 and [a, b] = [1, 2].

2) For each method, sketch the following errors with respect to the number n of iterations: 

    - **Error 1:** |pₙ - pₙ₋₁| / |pₙ|
    - **Error 2:** |pₙ - pₙ₋₁|
    - **Error 3:** |f(pₙ)| \
where (pₙ) is the sequence generated by each of these methods.

3) Use these graphs to compare the three methods.
