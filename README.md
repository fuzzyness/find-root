# Root Finding Methods in Rust
Approximate the root of a given function using several root finding methods.

1) Write a program to find an approximation to the solution to the equation 
f(x) = 0 lying in [a, b] that is accurate to within 10^-6, using \
   a. The bisection method \
   b. The fixed-point iteration method \
   c. The Newton's method \
   d. The secant method \
where f(x) = x^4 - 3x^2 - 3 and [a, b] = [1, 2].

2) For each method, sketch the following errors with respect 
to the number n of iterations: \
   Error 1 = |p_n - p_(n-1)| / |p_n| \
   Error 2 = |p_n - p_(n-1)| \
   Error 3 = |f(p_n)| \
where (p_n) is the sequence generated by each of these methods.

3) Use these graphs to compare the three methods.
