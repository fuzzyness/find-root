# Using error metrics to compare root-finding methods

Using the graphs that can be found in the `images` directory generated by the main program, we can draw conclusions for the efficiency and accuracy of each root-finding method.

## Error metrics used

**Error 1:** Relative error (|pₙ - pₙ₋₁| / |pₙ|)

The relative error shows how much each new approximation changes relative to its current value.

**Error 2:** Absolute error (|pₙ - pₙ₋₁|)

The absolute error directly measures the change between successive approximations.

**Error 3:** Function error (|f(pₙ)|)

The function error indicates how close the current approximation is to being an actual root.

## Root-finding methods

- **Newton's method:**

  This method tends to converge quadratically if the initial guess is close enough. The relative and absolute error graphs drop off very steeply compared to the other methods, and the function error approaches zero rapidly.

- **Secant method:**

  Typically displays super-linear convergence, which is faster than linear but not as fast as quadratic. It's graphs are similar to Newton's method but not as steep, especially if the initial guesses are not ideal.
  
- **Bisection method:**
  
  Guarantees convergence if the initial interval brackets a root, but its convergence rate is only linear. It's graphs show a steady and gradual decrease in errors.

- **Fixed-point iteration method:**

  The convergence rate of this method depends on the contraction constant of g(x). If g is only weakly contractive, the convergence will be slower, which can be seen in a more gradual decline in the error graphs.

# Comparing the methods
Newton's method and the secant method show much steeper error reductions, indicating faster convergence. The fixed-point iteration method shows slow convergence unless the iteration function g(x) is well chosen, and the bisection method shows steady error reduction, making it a middle ground between the faster Newton and secant methods and the slower fixed-point iteration method.
